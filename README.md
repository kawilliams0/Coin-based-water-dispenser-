*Introduction

The Coin-Based Water Dispenser is an automated system designed to dispense water when a valid coin is inserted. This project is ideal for use in public places where access to clean drinking water is provided for a small fee. The system ensures controlled water dispensing and minimizes water wastage.

*Features

Accepts specific coin denominations
Dispenses a fixed quantity of water per coin
User-friendly interface with LED indicators
Automatic valve control mechanism
Low power consumption
Secure and durable design

*Components Used

Microcontroller (Arduino/Raspberry Pi/Custom PCB)
Coin Acceptor Module
Solenoid Valve (for water control
LCD Display (optional, for user interface)
LED Indicators (status indicators)
Water Pump (if needed for non-gravity-based flow)
Power Supply Unit

*How It Works

A user inserts a coin into the coin acceptor.
The system verifies the coinâ€™s authenticity.
If the coin is valid, the microcontroller activates the solenoid valve.
Water is dispensed for a fixed duration or quantity.
After the set amount is dispensed, the valve automatically closes.

*Installation & Usage

Assemble all the hardware components.
Upload the microcontroller code.
Connect the system to a water source and power supply.
Test by inserting a valid coin.
Adjust settings like water dispensing time if needed.
